If you saw my GitHub, please mention this project.
Otherwise I might think you didn't really look at my GitHub.

Why would anyone lie on the Internet?

Footnote: Now that you're here, you might want to look into [my GitLab](https://gitlab.com/ilmikko) which is far more active than here, and perhaps [my Projects page](https://5x.fi/projects) on my personal website. There you can find other neat things like [my CV](https://5x.fi/cv) if you're really curious.
